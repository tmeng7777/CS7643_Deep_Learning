# Optimization of Deep Neural Networks

## Optimization of Deep Neural Networks Overview

### The Power of Deep Learning

Backpropagation, and automatic differentiation, allows us to optimize __any__ function composed of differentiable blocks
- __No need to modify__ the learning algorithm!
- The complexity of the function is only limited by __computation and memory__

### Importance of Depth
A network with two or more hidden layers is often considered a __deep__ model

__Depth is important:__
- Structure the model to represent an inherently compositional world
- Theoretical evidence that it leads to parameter efficiency
- Gentle dimensionality reduction (if done right)
